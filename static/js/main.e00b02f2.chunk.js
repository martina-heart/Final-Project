By 1966 Roger had not only progressed to drumming in Cornwall\'s most popular band, the Reaction, but had also become their lead singer, with his drum kit placed -- where else? -- in the principal position, at the front of the stage. That year, the Reaction won a hotly- contested local talent contest and, according to newspaper reports, were duly "mobbed by young girls".

Roger began writing songs for Queen from day one, and each of the band's fifteen studio albums included at least one of his compositions.

By the end of 1966, the band had a strong following throughout John\u2019s home turf of Leicester. But when, later that year, the Opposition's bassist left the band, it fell to John to fill the gap.

He began to learn Son And Daughter and a few other songs the group had been playing. Not long after, on 1 March 1971, John Richard Deacon became the fourth and final member of Queen, largely, as history recounts it, not only because he was a brilliant bass player, but he was also quiet and didn\u2019t try to upstage the others, particularly the band\u2019s lead singer, the very larger than life Freddie Mercury.
