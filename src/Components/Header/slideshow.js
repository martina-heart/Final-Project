        Queen are a British rock band formed in London in 1970.
      </h2>
      <h2 className="text1">
        Their classic line-up was Freddie Mercury (lead vocals, piano), Brian
        May (guitar, vocals), Roger Taylor (drums, vocals) and John Deacon
        (bass). Their earliest works were influenced by progressive rock, hard
        rock and heavy metal, but the band gradually ventured into more
        conventional and radio-friendly works by incorporating further styles,
        such as arena rock and pop rock.
