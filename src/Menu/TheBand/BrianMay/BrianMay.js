              With a musical career spanning four decades, Queen founding member
              Brian May is a world-renowned guitarist and songwriter, with
              production and performance credits on recordings which have sold
              in excess of 100 million copies worldwide. Brian has penned 22
              worldwide hits for Queen; among them the anthems We Will Rock You,
              The Show Must Go On and I Want It All, and powerful ballads
              including Who Wants to Live Forever, No-One But You (Only the Good
              Die Young) and Save Me. As a successful and respected solo artist,
              Brian’s recordings include the albums Back to the Light (1992),
              featuring Too Much Love Will Kill You and Driven By You, both Ivor
              Novello Award-winners, and 1998’s Another World. His songs
              continue to influence new generations of performers and have
              inspired recordings by artists as diverse as Elton John, Def
              Leppard, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, Shirley Bassey and
              Eminem. Brian has enjoyed collaborations with numerous artists
              including Robbie Williams, the Foo Fighters, Cliff Richard, Guns
              ‘n’ Roses, Diana Ross and Luciano Pavarotti. He was also proud to
              play feature guitar on the Winter Olympics 2002 opening music, The
              Fire Within for his friend and composer, the late Michael Kamen.

        Perhaps the most memorable display of Brian’s unique style and
        musicianship was his performance of his own arrangement of God Save the
        Queen, live from the roof of Buckingham Palace, to open HM The Queen’s
        2002 Golden Jubilee celebrations in front of an audience of more than
        200 million people around the world. An interest in film scoring
        developed when Queen became the first rock group to score a major film,
        Flash Gordon, featuring the hit Flash! penned by Brian. This was
        followed by definitive music for Highlander. Brian later contributed a
        mini-opera for Steve Baron’s 1996 Pinocchio, and composed a complete
        film soundtrack for the 1999 French art film Furia. May is, of course,
        no stranger to the theatrical world, frequently contributing to the live
        performance work of his wife Anita Dobson, but in 1987, entering this
        world in his own right, he wrote and performed the music for the London
        Riverside Studios production of Macbeth. He returned at full strength to
        the Theatre in 2002, as one of the principal creative forces behind the
        groundbreaking ‘rock theatrical’, We Will Rock You, which became
        phenomenally successful, and was one of London’s top-selling shows
        running for 12 years with nightly standing ovations at the Dominion
        Theatre, London, it was easily the longest- running show ever to play at
        the theatre. Although We Will Rock You is now a global enterprise, Brian
        remains personally involved in developing new productions and updating
        those currently playing. On Freddie’s death, the surviving members of
        Queen set up a charity to support AIDS relief, the Mercury Phoenix
        Trust. The MPT has to date channelled more than $16 million to over 800
        AIDS projects around the world. An ongoing commitment to AIDS awareness
        led Queen to become a driving force in the 46664 campaign for the Nelson
        Mandela Foundation. The first of a series of 46664 concerts, held in
        Cape Town in November 2003, was broadcast worldwide via TV, Internet and
        radio, becoming the most widely distributed media event in history, with
        an audience of over 2 billion in 166 countries. Brian continues in his
        role as an ambassador and participant in the 46664 international concert
        series aimed at promoting AIDS awareness worldwide.

        Queen’s musical catalogue consistently tops popularity polls, and their
        achievements have been recognised with numerous prestigious awards,
        including being honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame
        (October 2002), being inducted into both the USA Rock and Roll Hall of
        Fame (March 2001) and the Songwriters Hall of Fame (June 2003), and
        being among the first inductees into the UK Music Hall of Fame (November
        2004), which was the first event at which Paul Rodgers joined Brian and
        Roger as vocalist. A successful world tour together followed in 2005/06,
        and Paul, Brian and Roger (Taylor) then went into the studio to create
        new material for the well-received Queen/Paul Rodgers album The Cosmos
        Rocks, followed by a second giant world tour. In July 2005, Guinness
        World Records announced that Queen had overtaken the Beatles to become
        the most successful albums act in UK chart history. Brian’s further
        credits are too numerous to list, but they include designing a
        Planetarium show currently showing in Germany and Belgium; re-mixing
        classic Queen recordings in 5.1 Surround Sound; writing themes for
        several TV shows; producing a number 1 hit, The Stonk, for Comic
        Relief’s Red Nose Day; as well as lending his inspirational skills to
        the three top-selling volumes of The Best Air Guitar Album in the
        World...Ever! Retaining his keen interest in astronomy, Brian is a
        regular contributor to The Sky at Night for his long-time friend, Sir
        Patrick Moore, with whom he co-authored, along with Dr Chris Lintott, an
        illustrated astrophysics book entitled BANG! The Complete History of the
        Universe. First published in 2006, it has since been published in 20
        languages, and is currently in its third updated edition. Brian followed
        up with a unique book on another of his long-term passions, seminal
        1850s photographer T. R. Williams whose work Brian has been researching
        for over 30 years. The book, “A Village Lost and Found”, written with
        photohistorian Elena Vidal, is illustrated in 3-D, and includes a patent
        stereoscope of Brian’s own design.

        In December 2005, Brian was honoured with a CBE, Commander of the Order
        of the British Empire, by HM The Queen, in recognition of his services
        to music. In 2007, after a 30-year break pursuing his musical career,
        Brian returned to Imperial College, London, to sign up to complete his
        Doctoral Thesis in Astrophysics, and after one year, successfully
        submitted the new version of his thesis on Interplanetary Dust. Already
        the holder of honorary degrees from the Universities of Hertfordshire,
        Exeter and John Moore’s, Liverpool, Brian in 2007 finally achieved the
        award of a full PhD degree. Brian subsequently accepted a post of
        Visiting Researcher at Imperial College and will be continuing his work
        in astronomy. He is also currently the Chancellor or Liverpool John
        Moore’s University. In 2010 Brian founded Save-Me, a campaign devoted to
        preventing cruelty to wild animals. His work fighting the abuse of foxes
        and badgers led to him recently being awarded the honour of “Campaigner
        of the Year” by IFAW, the International fund for Animal Welfare. This
        work continues through the Save-Me website www.Save-Me.org.uk. Brian has
        continued to work outside of the Queen mothership with West End singer
        Kerry Ellis and together they have released three well received albums
        and toured successfully across Europe. Brian is also the owner of the
        London Stereoscopic Company and continues his interest in astronomy.
        Brian enjoys interacting with his friends and fans, who can contact him
        and enjoy updates on his work and thoughts via his own channel, Brian’s
        Soapbox, on his website at <i>www.brianmay.com</i>.
