              Although best known for his powerhouse role in Queen, Roger Taylor
              is anything but a drummer confined to his kit. With rock n’roll in
              his veins all through his schooldays, he has always been a highly
              active, vocal member of Queen. He famously wrote Queen’s landmark
              hits Radio Ga Ga and A Kind Of Magic, and was also the first to
              make a solo album, 1981’s Fun In Space. To date he has released 5
              solo albums, which, aside from his work with Queen, further
              highlighted Taylor as an musician and writer with a strong sense
              of identity, a wide musical perspective, and - not least of all -
              a man not without a sense of irony. Just consider, for instance,
              the lyrics to I’m In Love With My Car, his B side to Bohemian
              Rhapsody, and a firm audience favourite in the Queen live set.
              Taylor’s active approach has not been confined to his music: when
              media mogul Rupert Murdoch made attempts to buy Manchester United
              football club, Taylor funded the club supporters in their attempts
              to block the sale, and historically helped them succeed.

        His history in one of rock’s most famous bands begins in the late 60’s,
        the time when he first teamed up with Brian May, and later John Deacon
        and Freddie Mercury, to form Queen. But before that... Roger Taylor was
        born in Kings Lynn, Norfolk, on July 26th 1949, Roger became fascinated
        with music in the early 50s, when his family moved to Cornwall. He
        learned his first instrument, the ukulele, at a tender age, and enjoyed
        a brief taste of things to come in a pre-teen skiffle band whose
        collective talent survived just two public performances, both apparently
        excruciating! His music took on a different direction in 1960, when he
        became a rather reluctant member of the Truro Cathedral Choir -- a
        prerequisite of his scholarship. He taught himself the guitar around
        this time, but by the following year had moved over to drums. By 1966
        Roger had not only progressed to drumming in Cornwall's most popular
        band, the Reaction, but had also become their lead singer, with his drum
        kit placed -- where else? -- in the principal position, at the front of
        the stage. That year, the Reaction won a hotly- contested local talent
        contest and, according to newspaper reports, were duly "mobbed by young
        girls". While maintaining his keen interest in music, Roger decided to
        study dentistry, and in 1967 moved to London to enrol at the London
        Hospital Medical College. He later studied biology, obtaining a BSc in
        the subject.

        In 1968 Roger formed another group, Smile, with Middlesex guitar ace
        Brian May. Smile played sporadically over the next few years and even
        issued a single in the United States. By 1971, Roger had long abandoned
        any desire to become a dentist or a biologist, and with new additions to
        the line-up John Deacon and Freddie Mercury, Smile became known as
        Queen. The Queen legend often refers to how Taylor and Mercury were
        particularly close, and spent many hours on the town together seeing
        bands who at that time were their heroes: The Jimi Hendrix Experience,
        Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, The Who, all of whom influenced them and
        helped shape the musical destiny of Queen. Roger began writing songs for
        Queen from day one, and each of the band's fifteen studio albums
        included at least one of his compositions. History notes that all four
        members of Queen wrote No.1 singles: Taylor dutifully provided his with
        Radio Ga Ga , A Kind Of Magic and These Are The Days Of Our Lives
        amongst his.

        1977 was the landmark year in which Queen released We Are The Champions
        and We Will Rock You. Roger bought a Ferrari, and became the first
        member of Queen to launch a solo career with the release of the single I
        Wanna Testify. His solo album Fun In Space followed in 1981, and was
        succeeded by 1984's rock-based Strange Frontier. Both LPs reached the
        Top 30. In 1987 Roger formed his own band The Cross, in which after more
        than 20 years he finally resumed the role of lead singer. The Cross
        released three distinctive albums and toured extensively in the UK and
        Europe.

      <p className="text-f-css">
        After the tragic death of Freddie Mercury, Roger returned to his solo
        career with 1994's Happiness?, an album on which he explored the theme
        of "dealing with life and looking for happiness". The success of the
        album prompted further tours of the UK and Italy. Then came perhaps his
        most potent album, Electric Fire, which clearly showed Taylor as an
        acute observational songwriter. Rich in contemporary reflections on
        life, the album was full of attention-grabbing songs tackling
        thought-provoking and sometimes challenging issues — national
        obsolescence, domestic violence, and poverty, among them. One track,
        People On Streets, was inspired by visits Roger made to India and the
        inequalities he witnessed in the fortunes of that country's vast
        population. Never shy to express himself, several super- rich and
        powerful world figures get name checked in the song. That the Queen
        musical We Will Rock You came into being could be seen as something of a
        surprise taking into account Roger’s openly expressed view that
        “musicals are completely foreign to me. It’s a genre I don’t
        particularly like.” But after working closely with Brian and writer Ben
        Elton on shaping the musical, Taylor found himself deeply entrenched in
        developing the show, breaking the rules of musical theatre and taking on
        the role – along with Brian - as musical supervisor, not only for the
        first production in London, but for each of the subsequent productions
        throughout the world. To date, local productions of the show have
        reached 8 further countries.

        At the same time as setting up We Will Rock You, Roger and Brian played
        a central part in the formation of the Nelson Mandela 46664 charity,
        performing at the first two South Africa concerts, and providing several
        new songs to the 46664 album which saw them collaborate with the likes
        of Bono, Anastacia, Dave Stewart and Beyonce. Roger penned two new songs
        for the project, Say It’s Not True, a song about finding out you’re HIV
        positive, and Invincible Hope, based on the writings of Nelson Mandela
        and actually featuring the voice of Mandela reading phases from his
        autobiography. In 2005, after an accidental encounter with former Free
        singer Paul Rodgers, Roger and Brian felt the time was right to put
        Queen back on the road. Billed as Queen + Paul Rodgers, Roger and Brian
        tested the water with a handpicked set of European dates. Such was the
        momentum built up over the six week European tour, a US tour was booked
        to follow, which saw Roger and Brian return to the USA to play for the
        first time in more than 20 years. The impact of the return to the road
        was summed up in a review of is closing night in Vancouver: “the night
        that arena rock officially made its comeback”. Roger returned to his
        solo career in late 2009 with the release of the single The Unblinking
        Eye. A new solo album emerged in 2013, the critically acclaimed Fun On
        Earth, plus a comprehensive box set called The Lot which covered all his
        solo material and work with The Cross. Roger also oversees and produces
        The Queen Extravaganza, the official Queen Tribute act. The Queen
        Extravaganza is a spectacular touring concert show designed to take the
        music and live experience of Queen and bring it to generations of fans.
